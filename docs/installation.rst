Installation

Stable release
--------------

To install Astrochem ML, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/laserkelvin/astrochem_ml

When I get the chance, the package will be on PyPI; until then this is the recommended way of installation ``astrochem_ml`` and its dependencies.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
